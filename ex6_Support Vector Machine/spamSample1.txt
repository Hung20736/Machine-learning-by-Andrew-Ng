Tips for preparing to attend the Scholarship Interview

If you are selected for the next step in the Scholarship Application process, you will be invited to attend both an interview that has technical and non- technical questions. The interview will take approx. 20-30 minutes and you will be interviewed by 2 panel members. Preparing ahead will help you give clear and concise answers, and allow you to show your communication style and professional manner.

Determine the abilities and skills you have that would be relevant. Be ready to describe your strongest skills with examples in the following areas.

1.                  Passion, drive and career ambition in your field of study (engineering or other technology field, in particular, related to circuit design or software development)

2.                  Academic excellence

3.                  Determination to set and achieve goals

4.                  Respect for self, family and community

5.                  Future ability and passion to give lead and assist others in Vietnam and globally.

Research the Field/Industry of the Scholarship sponsors (the Essay question gives good hint about what is being evaluated). Think about why your studies, and the scholarship, will help you achieve your goals, and how it relates to the field/industry.

Answering Interview Questions

Answer questions using specific examples as needed to support your response. Where relevant focus on providing details for:

1.                  Situation/Task - describe a task or project for which you had responsibility or participation

2.                  Action - talk about your role and the approach you took to deal with the situation

3.                  Result - discuss the results of your actions and include accomplishments or improvements based on your efforts

Think about the most relevant and impressive aspects of your background and qualifications (including university/course projects, internships and volunteer work). Be ready to highlight the skills that you have developed and you believe are relevant in this field/industry

 

Communication Skills

The interviewers must be able to hear you, understand and follow your thought process. Speak clearly, stay calm, and provide examples as needed when answering questions.
